      Rainy days on the highway bring me back to that time my father drove my
      family home from the zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downpour was unrelenting, creating a thick waterfall across every
      square inch. We had narrowly escaped the rain while leaving the park, but
      upon entering the car and driving away, it was as if every single bucket
      in the sky suddenly tipped over.

      I remember how focused my dad was as he was driving, and how quiet my mom
      was, so as to let him focus. Under normal circumstances, she would have
      surely been backseat driving, telling my dad to watch out for certain cars
      or to turn here or turn there. But she apparently knew how distracting
      that could be, and so she kept silent. Or perhaps the rain simply left her
      speechless.

      In my child-like obliviousness to danger and the unknown, I was care-free,
      and my siblings and I joyfully passed the time tracking the raindrops as
      they slid across the window, racing one another until they disappeared out
      of view.

      It took me a number of years to realize the terrifying feeling of driving
      through hazardous road conditions, the feeling of helplessness and loss of
      control that could come about at any moment, the fact that every single
      driver surrounding me is likely feeling the same way, the fact that some
      drivers ignore this feeling and drive recklessly anyway.
    </p>

      We made it home safe and sound that evening, but it very well could have
      happened quite differently. There are so many different variables
      affecting an outcome in life, and it often feels like they are out of our
      control. But we need to steer through it anyway, slowly and with care, in
      the hopes that we will make it to the other side in one piece.
