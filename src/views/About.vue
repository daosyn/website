      there isn't much to say at the moment, i like to debug stuff and figure
      things out as i go. i make up for not knowing everything by always
      learning nuances and being fairly decent at troubleshooting. reading and
      writing good documentation is incredibly helpful and important.

      right now i am super obsessed with rock climbing. it gives me a similar
      sense of problem solving and is a really social sport. i'd recommend it to
      anyone!
