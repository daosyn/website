# Product Overview

Personal portfolio website for Brandon Dao (daosyn.info) featuring an interactive Rubik's cube navigation interface.

## Key Features

- Interactive 6x6 cube grid that randomly shuffles itself
- Responsive layout that adapts between landscape (desktop) and portrait (mobile) orientations
- Navigation routes embedded within cube facelets
- Personal content sections: about, photos, music (Last.fm), books (Goodreads), social (Mastodon), climbing, covers, and more
- Dark theme with custom "savior" font
- Static utility files (install script, GPG key) served from public directory

## Design Philosophy

Minimalist, playful interface with a focus on visual interaction. The scrambling cube metaphor ("life often scrambles itself") serves as both navigation and artistic expression.
